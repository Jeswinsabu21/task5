Generated network traffic by:

	Opening web pages in a browser.

	Running ping google.com in Command Prompt.(screeshot provided)

stopped capture after approximately 1 minute

filtered and analyzed traffic by protocol

identified protocols :
| Protocol   | Description                                                           |

summary:The packet capture shows the normal operation of a computer interacting with the internet. DNS resolved domain names, TCP established connections, and ICMP verified network connectivity. This demonstrates how different protocols work together in typical web and network communication.
